**** Version 5.3 / 6.0
Find work item reacts on enter

Documentation
	Added information about the build filter combobox on the test reporting pane.
	Extended section of link mapping and addes examples for better understanding.

Bugfixes
	In certain scenarios text was lost when generating Test Specification Reports.
	Selection of a another test plan leads to UI Exception if a sub suite was selected in the previous plan. 	
	The hyperlink to the licence agreement was broken and has been updated.

**** Version 5.2
	RefreshAllFieldsInDocument
		The post operation "RefreshAllFieldsInDocument" now includes the functionality to update all 				Tables of Figures and Tables of Content. 

	Console Extension User Notifications
		A lot of user noticications and error messages in command line mode did not provide as much information as needed to enable the user to find the root cause. This is due to the fact that in interactive mode the user can click a message and WordToTFS navigates to the affected work item, which is not possible in command line mode.
		In addition in some cases, the WordToTFS did provide different messages in command line mode than in interactive mode.
		To improve usability of user notifications and error messages in command line mode, these messages are now written in three different coloes (red, yellow, green).

	Variables functionality for test reporting
		The usage of variables in WordToTFS templates has been extended to all test reporting features.

	System Variables functionality introduced
		In addition to the variables that can be defined in WordToTFS templates and can be assigned with values in that templates a new mechanism has been introduced to provide compile time information in a similar way. The first system variable that is the only one, yet, provides the WordToTFS version number. This enables the user to store the version information of WordToTFS used for document generation in the document, which is a requirement especially in regulated environments.

	Enahnced field updates in post operations
		Whenever table of contents or table of figures has been updated by a post operation, only the page numbers were refreshed. Now the complete tables are updated which also adds new items if necessary.

	Saved Query Selector
		The display behavior of the selector for work item queries is now configurable. By default, the tree view showing work item queries is expanded. If you have a lot of queries you might not find it easy to navigate through the complete tree structure. Therefore, it is possible to add the attribute CollapsQueryTree=”true” to show a collapsed tree view initially. This configuration affects both occurrences: “Get Work Items” and “Test Specification Report By Query”.

	No post operations in case of an error
		In case of an error during document generation the post operations are not executed anymore. This makes it easier to identify a document as incomplete especialla after a unattended creation e.g. in command line mode.

	Builds in alphabetical order
		When creating a test result report the user now sees the available builds in alphabetical order which makes manual search easier.

	Requirements Based Suites
		Test Reports now fully support Requirements Based Test Suites.

	Bugfixes
		WordToTFS templates got minor updates, e.g. to correct misspellings.
		Work Item Link Viewer Fixed.
		In some cases a test result report threw a null reference exception when a linked build was selected.

	Test Spec and Test Result Report

		Title page can be generated with access to attributes from Document Root Cluster.
